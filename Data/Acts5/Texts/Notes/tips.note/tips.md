# Collate pro tips

1. Sync notes. If you'd like your notes accessible anywhere, simply put your collection inside a synced folder.  Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box offer ways to keep your files in sync.
  - [Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2374987?hl=en&ref_topic=6069785)
  - [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/)
  - [Box](https://sites.box.com/sync/)

2. Import data. Import data from Evernote using the built in importer! [Follow this tutorial](http://www.collatenotes.com/export-from-evernote/) to export your data from Evernote and into Collate.

3. Keyboard shortcuts. Customize keyboard shortcuts in the settings.

4. Too many panes? Click the Collate logo on the top left of the screen to collapse the Notebook and Tag pane.

5. Standalone editor. Right click on a note and choose 'Open in Editor' to open up a compact note editor.  Useful to save some screen real estate!

6. Multiple windows.  Need to reference more than one note?  Either open in the mini editor or click Collate > New Window in the menu bar to open up a new window.

7. Have an idea on how to improve Collate? Found a bug? Click Help > Open Help Pane > Report a bug  (It's okay if it's not a bug).
